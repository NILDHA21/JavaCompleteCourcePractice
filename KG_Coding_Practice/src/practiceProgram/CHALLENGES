• Implement a try-catch block to handle ArithmeticException.
• Display a user-friendly message if division by zero occurs.

97. Enhance the Day enum by adding an attribute that indicates whether it is a weekday or weekend. Add a method in the enum that returns whether it's a weekday or weekend, and write a program to print out each day along with its type.
98. Create a Map where the keys are country names (as String) and the values are their capitals (also String). Populate the map with at least five countries and their capitals. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a country name and then displays the corresponding capital, if it exists in the map.
